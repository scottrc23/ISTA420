Homework Questions

1. What is a data type? Why do we have data types?

An attribute that specifies the type of data of any object or define the characteristics of the data that can be stored in a location such as a database column.  They help enforce the expected type of data to be stored, we can achieve a much better result rooted in consistency and standard formatting.  It helps humans plan storage, calculations, performance for our db and programs.

2. What is a collation? Name four elements of a collation.

A collation is a set of rules that defines how to compare and sort character strings. Collation is a property of character data that encapsulates several aspects: language support, sort order, case sensitivity, accent sensitivity, and more.  Collation is a set of rules that tell database engine how to compare and sort the character data in SQL Server..

instance, database, column, and expression

3. How would you strip whitespace from a string? For example, suppose you had \ Dave " but wanted only \Dave".

select RTRIM(LTRIM)("\ Dave");

4. Suppose you wanted to make a list of every college and university that was called an Institute from the college table. Write the query.

SELECT * FROM college
WHERE column1 LIKE '%Institut%';

5. How would you  find the number of the index of the  first space in a string? For example, the index of the first space in \Barack Hussein Obama" would be 7.

CHARINDEX(' ', '\Barack Hussein Obama' position;

6. How would you select just the first name in a list of the presidents. Each record looks like the: "George Washington", "John Adams", "Thomas Jefferson". First names can be an arbitrary length, from \Cal" to \Benjamin." (e.g., Cal College, Benjamin Harrison)

SELECT SUBSTRING(president, 0, CHARINDEX(' ', president, 0)) AS FirstName
FROM (tablename)


7. What is the order of precedence for the logical operators?

5. NOT6. AND7. BETWEEN, IN, LIKE, OR8. = (Assignment

8. What is the order of precedence for the math operators?

1. ( ) (Parentheses)2. * (Multiplication), / (Division), % (Modulo)3. + (Positive), – (Negative), + (Addition), + (Concatenation), – (Subtraction)4. =, >, <, >=, <=, <>, !=, !>, !< 

9. What is the difference between a simple and a searched CASE expression?;

You use the simple form to compare one value or scalar expression with a list of possible values and return a value for the first match.

The searched CASE form is more flexible in the sense you can specify predicates in the WHEN clauses rather than being restricted to using equality comparisons

10. How would you turn a list of names like this: \LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME", to a list like this:\FIRSTNAME LASTNAME"?

SELECT  CONCAT( RIGHT(FirstNameLastName,LEN(FirstNameLastName) - SUBSTRING_INDEX(FirstNameLastName, ' ', 1)),
                ', ',
                LEFT(FirstNameLastName,SUBSTRING_INDEX(FirstNameLastName, ' ', 1) - 1)
                )
FROM    YourTable
